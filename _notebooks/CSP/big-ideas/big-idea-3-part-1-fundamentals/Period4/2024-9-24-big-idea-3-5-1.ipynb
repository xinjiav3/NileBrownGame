    "Relational Operators in Python are used to create a relationship between two entities usuually using comparisons such as involving comparisons such as equality, inequality, greater than, and less than. The operators then evaluvate the relationship between the entities and give an ouput of either True or False for the relationship.\n",

    "----------------------------\n",

    "\n",
    "The NOT function for booleans is a logical operator that inverts the value of a boolean expression. In simple terms:\n",
    "\n",

    "If the input is FALSE, the NOT function returns TRUE.\n",

    "In Boolean algebra:\n",
    "\n",
    "NOT(A)=¬A\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \n",
    " - A is a boolean value, and \n",
    " - ¬𝐴 is the negation of 𝐴\n",

    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "NOT(TRUE) = FALSE\n",
    "\n",
    "NOT(FALSE) = TRUE\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming languages, the NOT function is often represented by symbols like ! or the keyword not. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " - In C, C++, Java, etc.: !TRUE == FALSE\n",
    " - In Python: not True == False\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Real World Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially the NOT function is an INVERSE function\n",
    " - You put your shoes on in the morning, and you take your shoes off in the night\n",
    " - Wrapping a present before Christmas, unwrapping a present after Christmas\n",
    " - Setting up decorations for Halloween, taking out decorations after Halloween\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we learned about relational and logical operators in Python. Relational operators such as ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <= are used to compare values and determine relationships between them. Logical operators like \"and\", \"or\" ,and \"not\" are used to combine multiple differnt boolean expressions together and control the program's flow based on the conditons. Understanding how to use relational and logical operators are key for making decisions in code and implementing conditional logic. "
